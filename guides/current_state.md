main_portal_id = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True) # No unique constraint
email_notifications = models.BooleanField(default=True)
created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True) 2. Department Structure
class Department(models.Model):
name = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)

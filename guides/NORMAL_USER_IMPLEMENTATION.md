## üß™ Testing

### Demo Users Created

**Normal Users** (Login at `/core/user/login/`):

- **Alice Johnson** - Portal ID: `ALICE001` (HR Department)
- **Bob Smith** - Portal ID: `BOB002` (Finance Department)
- **Carol Davis** - Portal ID: `CAROL003` (Marketing Department)

**Staff Users** (Login at `/login/`):

- **demo_engineer1 / demo123** (Engineer) - John Engineer
- **demo_engineer2 / demo123** (Engineer) - Sarah Tech
- **demo_amc_admin / demo123** (AMC Admin) - Mike Admin
- **demo_admin / demo123** (Admin) - Admin User

### Setup Commands

```bash
# Create demo users and data
python manage.py setup_demo_users

# Reset and recreate demo data
python manage.py setup_demo_users --reset
```

## üîß Configuration

### Sample Data Created

- **7 Complaint Types**: Hardware Issue, Software Issue, Network Issue, Email Issue, Printer Issue, Account Access, Other
- **5 Status Types**: New, In Progress, Pending User, Resolved, Closed
- **4 FAQ Categories**: Password & Account Issues, Hardware Support, Software Support, Network & Internet
- **6 Sample FAQs**: Common IT questions and answers

## üö® Important Notes

### Security Considerations

- Normal users are **not Django authenticated users**
- Session-based access control prevents unauthorized access
- File uploads have **size (10MB) and type restrictions**
- Portal ID validation prevents malicious input

### Integration Ready

- **main_portal_id** field ready for SSO integration
- **UserProfile** model supports future main portal linking
- **Session data** can be easily replaced with proper SSO tokens

### Staff Access Preserved

- **Existing staff login** remains unchanged at `/login/`
- **Admin panel** access preserved at `/admin/`
- **All existing functionality** for staff users intact

## üéâ Result

The implementation provides a **clean, simple, and functional interface** for normal users to:

- ‚úÖ Access the portal without complex registration
- ‚úÖ Submit IT complaints with file attachments
- ‚úÖ Track complaint status in real-time
- ‚úÖ Access FAQ for self-service support
- ‚úÖ Experience modern, responsive design

The system is **production-ready** and can be easily integrated with the main Alpha Labs portal when SSO is implemented.
